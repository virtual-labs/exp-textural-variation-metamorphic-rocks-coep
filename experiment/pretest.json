			"question": "What are the rocks showing granulose structure called?",
			"answers": {

				"c": "Granilites",
				"d": "Granites"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation :The individual grains may be irregular in outline but are interlocking. Foliation is absent or negligible. Rocks with granular structure are termed as granulites.",

			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",

			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
